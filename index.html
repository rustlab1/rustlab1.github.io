    <h2>Welcome to RustLab</h2>
    <p>We are a research group focused on regenerative therapies for stroke using stem cells and molecular engineering. Follow our updates on <a href="https://twitter.com/rust_ruslan" target="_blank">X (Twitter)</a>.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>Every year 5 million people remain permanently disabled after a stroke due to the brain’s limited ability to regenerate damaged tissue. The lack of an effective therapy that promotes long-term recovery after stroke represents a substantial clinical burden and unmet need for medical treatment outside the confines of conventional therapies. Recent advances in cell therapies have shown promising preclinical results in animal stroke models but have not been confirmed beyond doubt in a clinical setting. Major uncertainties remain e.g., regarding the source of the transplanted cells, immune compatibility to the recipient, and cell survival and functional integration into the damaged neural circuitry.</p>

    <h3>Research Goals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Functionalize and target the cells towards specific ischemic stroke environment</li>
      <li>Develop a cell shuttle system to facilitate the migration of cells across the blood brain barrier</li>
      <li>Reduce immune incompatibility to the recipient by interference with the HLA system</li>
      <li>Preconditioning and hydrogel-embedding of cells to improve graft survival</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Main Techniques</h3>
    <p>Rodent surgeries, behavioral tests, DeepLabCut, bioluminescent imaging, laser Doppler imaging, fluorescent and confocal imaging, cell culture, cell-specific genetic manipulation, transcriptomics, immunofluorescence, qPCR, molecular biology, and more.</p>
